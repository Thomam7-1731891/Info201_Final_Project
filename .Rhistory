coming from each president. Trump's tweets have an enormous amount of negative words, consistently outstripping Obama's tweets every year. When thought of in context, we,
as a public, already know Trump's infamous reputation for using Twitter to vent. He constantly insults other people, perpetuating the hashtag #crookedHillary for instance, while
Obama's tweets show no record of such a thing. In fact, Obama's tweets seem to be more about the going's on of the government, discussing policy and the like (as seen in other
analysis tabs) over insulting other people."),

followers, and insult his opposers, over Obama's seemingly more positive-leaning nature. However, at the same time, we have to look at the actual numbers of the Word Counts.
You'll notice that while Obama reaches over 8000 in positive values regularly, matching Trump consistently, he has very low values for all of his other categories. We can thus
say that Trump's tweets are far more emotional than Obama's, be it good or bad emotion."),

while Obama's tweets, aside from some that are obviously personal, are more likely to be managed by a press manager or assistant. We get a better feel for the thought process
and personality of Trump rather than Obama, as we're exposed to more of Trump's negative thoughts, rather than mostly poster-boy positivity. If this is good or bad, I couldn't tell
you, and leave you to draw your own conclusions. Overall, it seems that Trump is far more emotionally invested, and is thus a larger presence, in social media than Obama.")
