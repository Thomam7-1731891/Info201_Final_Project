## Section 1. Problem Domain Description

The domain of the issue investigated is the social media platform "Twitter" and "tweets" made by President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama.

Twitter is a social media platform that allows people to send out short messages called "tweets", accompanied by pictures and other small links to their "followers", people
who willingly choose to get updates on new tweets from a person. As Presidents of the US, Obama and Trump have an extremely large amount of followers. Tweets often contain
personal opinions and comments on current societal matters, particularly in the case of the President of the United States for obvious reasons.

But why should anyone care? For the same reasons listed above - tweets will often contain the personal views and sentiments of the person making them. It is incredibly important
that every member of the United States of America knows what their President is like, and what that person thinks of the current issues that plague society. Maybe they ignore
issues that every American finds important, maybe they pay attention to them, etc. 

### Section 1.1 Critical Analysis Questions

Of course, when given such a breadth of data, one should be able to concisely ask the cutting questions. Here's what we came up with:

1. What does the general reception to the tweets, with a baseline of average likes and favorites/retweets between them, say about the president making them and the people liking them? Given that Obama and Trump come from quite literally the opposite sides of the political spectrum, this should say a lot about what the reception of the US to each president and the general beliefs of the people in the country that we live in.

2. One thing that President Trump is known for is using the phrase "Make America Great Again", and he often uses simple language to preach his messages to his followers. But how often does he tweet things like this? Let's look at how often he uses the word "Great" in his tweets in comparison to the total amount of tweets he posts.
  
3. how do the presidents portray their image to their folowers? Do they tend to keep their tweets neutral and level-headed, or do they respond with emotionally evoking pathos in most of their tweets? 

4. How often do the presidents interact with the public over Twitter? Do they retweet any messages from their followers? Do they directly reply to questions? We can interpret how engaged the presidents are by finding the percentages of tweets that are retweets, responses, in comparison to the amount of all tweets, and then compare the two presidents with each other.

## Section 2 Data Description 

Taking a closer look at the actual data sets, below we will explore what the data sets consist of on the surface level, by defining terms and summarizing the overview of the data sets. 

1. The data sets show Donald Trump and Barack Obama's tweets with a description of the tweet, the date and time, favorites, and retweets. The Donald Trump data set is from the Twitter database website where we got access through an API key: [Trump Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview). 
```{section 2 trump, echo = FALSE}
kable(sample_trump_df)
```
2. The Barack Obama data set is from the database website Periscope updated one year ago by a user name Sean Cook. Here is a link to the source: [Obama Tweets](https://community.periscopedata.com/t/x1fy7p/barack-obamas-tweet-history)
```{section 2 obama, echo = FALSE}
kable(sample_obama_df)
```

#### Definitions
* Tweet Text: The actual content of the text by each president during their presidential term. 
* Date: The date each president posted the tweet.
* Favorites: The number of times people that favorited the tweet, signifying that they liked or agreed with the tweet. 
* Retweets: The number of times the tweet was reposted or forwarded by people. This feature help share and spread the tweet around with people's own followers.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Section 4 Proposed Data Presentation

### Question 1
To provide a better perspective on how to compare how the general public 
responds favorably to the tweets from both figures, the top 10 tweets in terms of likes 
can be displayed in the form of a scatter plot, where the x-value will
be organizized from the top ten liked tweets, from largest to lowest. The y-value
will be the number of likes. Both the likes from the Obama dataset and the Trump
dataset will be included to compare the results to identify which figure 
tends to have a larger favorability because scatter plots makes it easy 
to compare values. The colors of the points are different between the two presidents to indicate who's data represents who

### Question 2
In regards to identifying the percentage of tweets about policy and issues in regards
to insults. We can filter the data to search for important public policies, and calculate
the percentage of tweets that relate to that and compare it with the total amount of tweets.
To visualize this, we can create a bar graph to illustrate the total amount of tweets and the number that are only about policies. To get the percentage, you would just have to divide the policy tweets by the total tweets by 100. The x-value is the total number of tweets, and the y-value is the different categories of tweets. Each column is colored differently and labeled.

### Question 3
To have a better understanding of how the president's personality and how they react to situations, we can filter using a list of emotionally provoking words such as "great", "fear", "outrageous", and categorize them by emotion to identify what percentage of tweets indicates what emotion. The visual display would be a bar graph to easily display a comparison of the different number of tweets related to each emotion. The x-values are the emotions, the y-values would be the number of tweets. Each bar is the same color but each column is labelled to indicate which emotion.

### Question 4
In order to answer this question, we need to identify which tweets are retweets and which
"@" directly at another twitter handle indicating interaction between the two accounts. By 
filtering for those, we can then compare the tweets we have selected with the total
number of tweets within a pie chart, to see the proportion of tweets that the presidents
retweet and the proportion of tweets used to reply to others. Each section of the pie charts are colored differently and labeled with a key to indicate what each category represents.
